\item{columns}{character vector for column heading for cells to summarise}

\item{grouping_columns}{character vector of other columns to use as grouping, such as region classification column}
}

Currently this function is experimental as it only handles data that has text in the columns. Eventually,
will be able to handle any data inputs such as those from HALO where cells are designated as positive (1) or
