	abstract = {Accurate cell typing is fundamental to analysis of spatial single-cell transcriptomics, but legacy scRNA-seq algorithms can underperform in this new type of data. We have developed a cell typing algorithm, Insitutype, designed for statistical and computational efficiency in spatial transcriptomics data.Insitutype is based on a likelihood model that weighs the evidence from every expression value, extracting all the information available in each cell{\textquoteright}s expression profile. This likelihood model underlies a Bayes classifier for supervised cell typing, and an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering. Insitutype also leverages alternative data types collected in spatial studies, such as cell images and spatial context, by using them to inform prior probabilities of cell type calls. We demonstrate rapid clustering of millions of cells and accurate fine-grained cell typing of kidney and non-small cell lung cancer samples.Competing Interest StatementPD, EZ, ZY, DR, MG, ZR, TKK, SH, DH and JMB are current/former employees and shareholders of NanoString.},

	abstract = {Background Immunotherapy (IO) has improved survival for patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but resistance to therapy develops in most patients. We use cellular-resolution spatial transcriptomics in patients with IO na{\"\i}ve and IO exposed primary ccRCC tumors to better understand IO resistance. Spatial molecular imaging (SMI) was obtained for tumor and adjacent stroma samples. Spatial gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and autocorrelation (coupling with high expression) of ligand-receptor transcript pairs were assessed. Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) validation was used for significant autocorrelative findings and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and the clinical proteomic tumor analysis consortium (CPTAC) databases were queried to assess bulk RNA expression and proteomic correlates.Results 21 patient samples underwent SMI. Viable tumors following IO harbored more stromal CD8+ T cells and neutrophils than IO na{\"\i}ve tumors. YES1 was significantly upregulated in IO exposed tumor cells. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway was enriched on spatial GSEA and the associated transcript pair COL4A1-ITGAV had significantly higher autocorrelation in the stroma. Fibroblasts, tumor cells, and endothelium had the relative highest expression. More integrin αV+ cells were seen in IO exposed stroma on mIF validation. Compared to other cancers in TCGA, ccRCC tumors have the highest expression of both COL4A1 and ITGAV. In CPTAC, collagen IV protein was more abundant in advanced stages of disease.Conclusions On spatial transcriptomics, COL4A1 and ITGAV were more autocorrelated in IO-exposed stroma compared to IO-na{\"\i}ve tumors, with high expression amongst fibroblasts, tumor cells, and endothelium. Integrin represents a potential therapeutic target in IO treated ccRCC.Competing Interest StatementCompeting interests: The corresponding author certifies that all conflicts of interest, including specific financial interests and relationships and affiliations relevant to the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript (ie. employment/affiliation, grants or funding, consultancies, honoraria, stock ownership or options, expert testimony, royalties, or patents filed, received, or pending), are the following: ACS, MTH, TCP, OEO, NHC, AEB, PAS, JN, CMS, NLF, PMRE, KYT, JAB, YCP, JD, LAM, WEG, and BLF have no relevant disclosures; BJM is an NCCN Kidney Cancer Panel Member and an advisor for Merck; RL received research support from Predicine, Veracyte, CG Oncology, Valar Labs, and Merck, is on the clinical trials committee for CG Oncology, is scientific advisor for Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, Fergene, Arquer Diagnostics, Urogen Pharma, Lucence, CG Oncology, and Janssen, and has received honoraria from SAI MedPartners, Solstice Health Communications, Putnam Associates, and UroToday; JJM is Associate Center Director at Moffitt Cancer Center, has ownership interest in Aleta Biotherapeutics, CG Oncology, Turnstone Biologics, Ankyra Therapeutics, and AffyImmune Therapeutics, and is a paid consultant/paid advisory board member for ONCoPEP, CG Oncology, Turnstone Biologics, Vault Pharma, Ankyra Therapeutics, AffyImmune Therapeutics, UbiVac, Vycellix, and Aleta Biotherapeutics; NS, SK, and MG are or formerly were employees of Nanostring.},

    abstract = {New technologies, such as multiplex immunofluorescence microscopy (mIF), are being developed and used for the assessment and visualization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). These assays produce not only an estimate of the abundance of immune cells in the TIME, but also their spatial locations. However, there are currently few approaches to analyze the spatial context of the TIME. Therefore, we have developed a framework for the spatial analysis of the TIME using Ripley’s K, coupled with a permutation-based framework to estimate and measure the departure from complete spatial randomness (CSR) as a measure of the interactions between immune cells. This approach was then applied to epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) using mIF collected on intra-tumoral regions of interest (ROIs) and tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 160 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients in the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) (94 subjects on TMAs resulting in 263 tissue cores; 93 subjects with 260 ROIs; 27 subjects with both TMA and ROI data). Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the association of abundance and spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3+), cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+CD3+), and regulatory T-cells (CD3+FoxP3+) with overall survival. Analysis was done on TMA and ROIs, treating the TMA data as validation of the findings from the ROIs. We found that EOC patients with high abundance and low spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and T-cell subsets in their tumors had the best overall survival. Additionally, patients with EOC tumors displaying high co-occurrence of cytotoxic T-cells and regulatory T-cells had the best overall survival. Grouping women with ovarian cancer based on both cell abundance and spatial contexture showed better discrimination for survival than grouping ovarian cancer cases only by cell abundance. These findings underscore the prognostic importance of evaluating not only immune cell abundance but also the spatial contexture of the immune cells in the TIME. In conclusion, the application of this spatial analysis framework to the study of the TIME could lead to the identification of immune content and spatial architecture that could aid in the determination of patients that are likely to respond to immunotherapies.},
